# JavaCoffeeCo
JavaCoffeeCo project for CS160L
To run this application, you will need all files provided and you can run it though the main class. The Coffee.java file is the interface of this program. The CoffeeDecorator.java is an abstract class. There are many topping files provided which have 3 methods to add toppings to a coffee order, print the order, and return the cost of each order. The main.java file provided is the driver class of the program which includes the main method. This allows a user to create a coffee order and add toppings, can handle the inventory, and puts all orders into one file to store history of orders. The Inventory.txt file is the file that contains the current inventory at the coffee shop and the LogFile.txt file contains the history of all orders.
